Wayfare is a simple app made to help you easily calculate your discretionary income. It's tailored for nomads and remote workers who move often, hence the name.

You tell Wayfare your monthly income and fixed monthly expenses, and Wayfare will show you how much you have left to safely use. You can add multiple cities with different monthly expenses, and Wayfare will do the math for you. Wayfare can also extrapolate monthly data to other time intervals (e.g. 3mo, 1yr).

That's about it. There's not much to it. It's just a tool I personally needed but didn't find. So I made it myself.

It's built using React, Redux, Firebase, and a few other libraries.

It's still a work in progress and is currently super buggy.
